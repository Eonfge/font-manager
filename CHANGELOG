Major changes between 0.7.3 to 0.7.4

- Drop dependency on gucharmap library.

    Gucharmap is no longer in active development, and while the developers
    were receptive to changes, our changes are so invasive that they wouldn't
    make much sense upstream.

- Drop dependency on Gee library

- Drop Intltool

- Determine whether file-roller is available at runtime.

    --with-file-roller flag dropped.

- Closes Issue #16

    Character map now only displays those codepoints which are present in selected font.
